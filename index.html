        <h2>What is Haikyu</h2>
        <p>Haikyu is a Japanese volleyball manga series written and illustrated Haruichi Faledate. This manga/anime is about a short boy named Shoyo Hinata so he can become the best volleyball player but he is short so its gonna be challenging for him.
        Hinata shoyo wanted to be like a volleyball championship player, a short player nicknamed "the small giant"

        In third and final year of junior high, some of Hinata's friends agree to join the club so he can compete in a tournament. In his first official game ever, they suffer a crushing defeat to the team favored to win the tournament â€“ that included third-year Tobio Kageyama, a prodigy setter nicknamed 'The King of the Court' for both his skill and his brutal play style. The two spark a short rivalry, and after the game, Hinata vows to defeat Kageyama in high school.
